## Question 1
**Question:** What is Python?  Give a brief description.

**Answer:** Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It's interpreted, meaning code is executed line by line without needing a separate compilation step.  Python is used in various applications, from web development and data science to scripting and automation.


## Question 2
**Question:** What are variables in Python? Give an example.

**Answer:** Variables are named storage locations that hold data.  You assign a value to a variable using the `=` operator. For example: `name = "Alice"` creates a variable named `name` and assigns it the string value "Alice".


## Question 3
**Question:** What are data types in Python? Name three common ones.

**Answer:** Data types specify the kind of value a variable can hold. Three common data types are:
* **int:**  Represents integers (whole numbers), e.g., `10`, `-5`, `0`.
* **float:** Represents floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points), e.g., `3.14`, `-2.5`.
* **str:** Represents strings (text), e.g., `"Hello"`, `"Python"`.


## Question 4
**Question:** What is the purpose of the `print()` function in Python?

**Answer:** The `print()` function displays output to the console (your screen).  For example, `print("Hello, world!")` will print "Hello, world!" on the console.


## Question 5
**Question:** How do you add a comment to your Python code?

**Answer:** You add a comment using the `#` symbol.  Anything after `#` on a line is ignored by the Python interpreter.  For example: `# This is a comment`.


## Question 6
**Question:** What is an operator in Python? Give an example of an arithmetic operator.

**Answer:** An operator performs an operation on one or more values (operands). An arithmetic operator performs mathematical calculations.  For example, `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division) are arithmetic operators.


## Question 7
**Question:** What is the difference between `=` and `==` in Python?

**Answer:** `=` is the assignment operator; it assigns a value to a variable. `==` is the equality operator; it compares two values and returns `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise.


## Question 8
**Question:** What is a string in Python? How do you create one?

**Answer:** A string is a sequence of characters (text). You create a string by enclosing text within single quotes (`'...'`) or double quotes (`"..."`).  For example: `my_string = "Hello"` or `my_string = 'Python'`.


## Question 9
**Question:** How do you concatenate two strings in Python?

**Answer:** You concatenate (join) two strings using the `+` operator.  For example: `string1 = "Hello"`, `string2 = " World!"`, `result = string1 + string2` will result in `result` containing "Hello World!".


## Question 10
**Question:** What is a list in Python?

**Answer:** A list is an ordered, mutable (changeable) sequence of items.  Items can be of different data types.  You create a list using square brackets `[]`.  For example: `my_list = [1, 2, "apple", 3.14]`.


## Question 11
**Question:** How do you access an element in a list?

**Answer:** You access elements in a list using their index (position), starting from 0. For example, `my_list[0]` accesses the first element of `my_list`.


## Question 12
**Question:** What is an if-else statement in Python?

**Answer:** An if-else statement allows you to execute different blocks of code based on a condition.  If the condition is true, the code within the `if` block runs; otherwise, the code within the `else` block runs.


## Question 13
**Question:** What is a loop in Python? Name one type of loop.

**Answer:** A loop repeatedly executes a block of code. One type of loop is the `for` loop, which iterates over a sequence (like a list or string).


## Question 14
**Question:** What does the `len()` function do?

**Answer:** The `len()` function returns the length (number of items) of a sequence, such as a string or a list.


## Question 15
**Question:** What is an input function in Python?

**Answer:** The `input()` function allows the user to enter data from the keyboard.  The entered data is returned as a string.


## Question 16
**Question:**  What is type casting in Python?  Give an example.

**Answer:** Type casting converts a value from one data type to another.  For example, `int("10")` converts the string "10" to the integer 10.


## Question 17
**Question:** What is a Boolean value?

**Answer:** A Boolean value represents truth or falsehood; it can be either `True` or `False`.


## Question 18
**Question:** What is the purpose of an `import` statement?

**Answer:** The `import` statement allows you to use modules (pre-written code) in your program.


## Question 19
**Question:** What is a function in Python?

**Answer:** A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.


## Question 20
**Question:** How do you define a function in Python?

**Answer:** You define a function using the `def` keyword followed by the function name, parentheses `()`, and a colon `:`. The function body is indented.


## Question 21
**Question:** What is a module in Python?

**Answer:** A module is a file containing Python code (definitions and statements).


## Question 22
**Question:**  What is a tuple in Python?

**Answer:** A tuple is an ordered, immutable (unchangeable) sequence of items.  Tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.


## Question 23
**Question:** What is the difference between a list and a tuple?

**Answer:** Lists are mutable (can be changed), while tuples are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).


## Question 24
**Question:** What is a dictionary in Python?

**Answer:** A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.  Keys are unique and immutable, while values can be of any data type. Dictionaries are defined using curly braces `{}`.


## Question 25
**Question:** How do you access a value in a dictionary using its key?

**Answer:** You access a value using its key by placing the key within square brackets `[]` after the dictionary name. For example: `my_dict["key"]` returns the value associated with the key "key".
